My name is Joshua. I spent the better part of my life's summers building and restoring houses and apartments with my father. However, currently I develop software for a West Virginia state entity called WVNET.

I like to believe that learning to build strong, robust houses and physical structures in scalable and maintainable ways has rubbed off on me and influenced the way that I build my software. 

I hate that of these three things: fast, good quality, and low cost, you can always only have two. Because I currently lead most of my projects as an individual, without a team, I often choose good quality and low cost. But to me, quality is something that cannot be replaced, no matter how fast the product is completed. 

Without quality, what is there?
